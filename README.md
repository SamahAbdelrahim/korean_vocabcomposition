# korean_vocabcomposition
An online experiment to collect norming scores from korean native speakers on the first 300 words from the Korean MCDI sourced from wordbank. 

The judgements are collected for three dimensions:

1- solidity

2- countability

3- category organization on shape, color, material, or something else
